# Mailchimp

This application adds a sidebar that lets you see Mailchimp's rating, campaign and subscription information of ticket's owner

## Authentication

Once you complete the authorization process, the application will store your access token which will be used by all agents or admins
to make requests to the Mailchimp API. 

The actual Deskpro users can not actually see or use the token for anything else other than making requests to Mailchimp, but since the token is tied to the account you use to authorize the app with Mailchimp, it is recommended you choose a Mailchimp account other than your Mailchimp admin account.
